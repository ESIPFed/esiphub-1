# ESIPHub: Supporting Interactive Geoscience Workshops

ESIPhub is an incubator project of the [Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Lab](http://www.esipfed.org/esip-lab) initiative to develop a template for deploying a customized JupyterHub environment to support workshops at ESIP annual meetings.  Each year, scientists, engineers, educators, and practitioners convene to discuss their work, share ideas, and learn new tools and techniques. Workshops are often interactive and sometimes developed around applications such as Jupyter Notebooks. The goal of this project is to provide a framework for deploying JupyterHub using a standardized workshop configuration to provide predictability for instructors and reduce the time to setup.

Aspects of the project include:
* Cost estimates for hosting ESIPhub for development and at scale for workshops
* Information sharing within the ESIP and NDS communities
* Ability to deploy on both commercial cloud (AWS) and OpenStack environments (NCSA Nebula, SDSC Cloud, and XSEDE JetStream)
* Authentication using ESIP credentials

As a result, the ESIP community will have a predictable method to deploy a custom JupyterHub environment for each workshop and understand the operational costs.
